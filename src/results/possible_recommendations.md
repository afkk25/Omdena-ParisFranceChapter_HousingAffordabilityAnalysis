## Possible Recommendations

In considering future improvements to the dashboard, please consider the following:

- Design improvements
  - 3D maps
  - Actual front-end tooling
    - Streamlit is quite limited in terms of front-end capabilities. It has HTML support, but still very restricted
    - Explore conversion into HTML and CSS through appropriate JS scripting (or employ frameworks)
    - Can provide tons of room for design flexibility and user accommodation
- Testing
  - No scripts were dedicated to testing certain functions employed in the dashboard
  - Crucial for DevOps
- API construction and deployment
  - Current source of truth is a merged dataset; fixed and prone to inaccuracies over time
